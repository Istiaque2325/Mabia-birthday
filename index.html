            <p class="poem-line">It began like a whisper in the dark â€”</p>
            <p class="poem-line">A sudden Facebook spark,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">A simple "hello"...</p>
            <p class="poem-line">Yet something burned beneath the surface.</p>
            
            <p class="poem-line">Then one day â€” she stood before me.</p>
            <p class="poem-line">Not a screen, not a nameâ€¦</p>
            <p class="poem-line">But a woman, breathtaking and dangerously real.</p>
            
            <p class="poem-line">I had never explored life like that before â€”</p>
            <p class="poem-line">With her, I wanted to taste every moment.</p>
            
            <p class="poem-line">That dayâ€¦</p>
            <p class="poem-line">Allah, that day was unlike any I had ever known.</p>
            <p class="poem-line">She was sweetness wrapped in sin,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">Her smile? Uffâ€¦.</p>
            <p class="poem-line">Like a secret the moon tells only the ocean.</p>
            <p class="poem-line">Soft, seductive, addictive.</p>
            
            <p class="poem-line">Every second beside her</p>
            <p class="poem-line">Felt like a forbidden page I couldn't stop reading.</p>
            
            <p class="poem-line">The rickshaw swayed, but her presence held me steady.</p>
            <p class="poem-line">When I slipped my hand into hers â€”</p>
            <p class="poem-line">It was fire,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">A silent electricity that made my hormons ache for more.</p>
            
            <p class="poem-line">Our eyes locked â€”</p>
            <p class="poem-line">And suddenly, nothing else existed.</p>
            <p class="poem-line">Time dissolved.</p>
            <p class="poem-line">Desire lingered between glances, unspoken but alive.</p>
            
            <p class="poem-line">And when the moment came to partâ€¦</p>
            <p class="poem-line">She pulled me into a hug,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">And I swear â€”</p>
            <p class="poem-line">Every darkness in me disappeared.</p>
            
            <p class="poem-line">The scent of her hair, the press of her warmth,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">It wasn't just comfortâ€¦</p>
            <p class="poem-line">It was a promise.</p>
            
            <p class="poem-line">I wanted to live in that breath,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">In her every sigh and silent moan.</p>
            
            <p class="poem-line">Her touch wasn't just physical â€”</p>
            <p class="poem-line">It was worship.</p>
            <p class="poem-line">And I?</p>
            <p class="poem-line">I was already addicted.</p>
            
            <p class="poem-line final-line">To her mind.</p>
            <p class="poem-line final-line">To her madness.</p>
            <p class="poem-line final-line">To the way her presence undressed every part of meâ€¦</p>
            <p class="poem-line final-line">Even the ones I'd hidden from myself.</p>
